Use the API https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=40315881b5af1985a7ceba1f41b45973&language=en-US 
to get a list of popular movies and show them in an auto scrolling carousel (from left to right)

displaying the image, title, ratings, if it's adult, then blur the image (and unblur it on hover),
and release date.
Be sure to take care of loading states and error states during API calls.

We will also evaluate on component design.

Try using typescript if possible.
For mobile view, it should show two movies side by side,
 and then two more below it and so on. The movement should be from bottom to top instead 
 of right to left.

Querying the API:
- To query the API, you will need to setup a backend process that queries the API and proxies the 
result to the frontend.
- In case you do not know how to make a backend process, you can mock the reply on the frontend.


Bonus:
- Add a try again button to the error state
- Make styling better (make it more pretty)
- Lazy loading of images as the person is about to scroll the image into the view.
- Make a better loading state (for example, instead of just showing the loading text, show placeholder boxes with some loading animation)
